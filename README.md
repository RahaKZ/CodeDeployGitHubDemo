This is sample experimentation of using CodeDeploy.
I am just following [this page by bogotobogo](https://www.bogotobogo.com/DevOps/AWS/aws-CodeDeploy-Deploy-an-Application-from-GitHub.php)

But this is the actual tutorial. I should have followed this [official one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/tutorials-github-create-github-repository.html)

It contains also cleanup step.
